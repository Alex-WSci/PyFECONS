1. Download the code notebook .ipynb file
2. Open the Overleaf link corresponding to that code
3. Enter inputs in the code, and run all cells. This will hydrate the 'originals' templates.
4. Go to overleaf and 'pull' from github into overleaf
5. Run the 'modified' main .tex file
6. A hydrated report should have compiled

7. To edit the text, edit the 'originals' .tex files corresponding to the cost category you would like to edit.
8. Download the .tex files and overwrite in the 'original' file of the corresponding case in the shared google drive
9. Refresh code and repeat steps 3-6.
